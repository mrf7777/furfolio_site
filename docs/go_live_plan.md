future of FF notes.

why?
- to create software
- to help the FF community & to learn about web dev & to build CV
- to job hp
- for growth
- for money
- to give back
- they provide meaning
- to buy FS
- to participate in community
- to make rel.
- meaning
- root cause: to establish rel.

how?
- plan of attack
  - cultural beta
    - site goes live, no formal beta, just warn users that there may be breaking changes
    - when does beta finish?
      - define a roadmap
      - beta closes when sufficient bugs and features on the roadmap are completed.
      - increase community interest by having a percentage timeline
    - ask for feedback
      - to improve site
      - to engage users
      - ask about:
        - general rating
        - things they did not like
        - feed into an AI to summarize
    - monitization
      - donation model setup
  - post-beta
    - defines the end of the beta and that the site is live for regular use
    - still need feedback
      - keep discord alive
      - point system to score users?
        - names?: experience, senority, tally,
  - regular lifecycle
    - maintnaince
      - testing
      - refactoring
    - monitization
      - keep donation model
        - start to increase asking for dontations
          - at the completion of commissions
          - after signup
          - during blog posts
      - subscription model
        - reduce limits, unlock features, optional public badge
        - more strong forecast information to me
        - reduce risk in hiring
        - may be time to create an LLC first
      - pay to rank
        - pay to rank some offers higher in search results
          - feels too competitive and anti-cultural to me
      - merch
        - not as predictive as sub model
        - extra points of failure with 3rd party business
        - might be easy to get money early and consider brand development
        - is monitization of software hype to kickstart funding for more development
      - monitization models ranked, best first: donation, merch, sub, rank
    - moderation
      - community-based moderation would be very helpful here if low on funds
      - we already have community tag moderation
      - legal requirements and response (LLC)

# ideas
- automation as a seperate model
  - commission automation pass 1
    - define a precondition
      - there is a domain of discourse here, in this case, commissions.
      - example: commission A is closed
      - example: commission A is in group "YCHs"
      - multiple preconditions with the same commission A
    - define an action
      - append text to description of commission A
      - append to title of commission A
  - commission automation pass 2
    - define variables of discourse
      - for example, let A be a commission
    - define preconditions
      - example: A is in group "YCHs"
      - example: A is past cutoff date
      - example: A is before cutoff date
    - define action (single action is important since actions need to be executed in sequence. 'A' may be invalid in a later action)
      - delete A
      - create offer from template "Default Template"
      - change thumbnail in A to this image
- sign-in with qr code on kiosk or laptop
  - let a kiosk have a QR code that says "Scan me to sign in"
  - The phone scans the QR code
  - The QR code is a url of the form "https://furfolio.net/qr-code-sign-in/<unique qr code request id>"
  - If the phone has an authenticated session, it will POST to the server about the signed in user and the QR code
    - url POSTed to may be "https://furfolionet/qr-code-sign-in/<qr code request id>/sign-in"
    - POSTed data may be just the cookies. the server will see the signed in user and 
      
# actual plan of attack for beta and release
- 1 create production FF (time estimate: 2-3 days)
  - create a production branch which keeps track of current FF commit to use in production
  - create a digital ocean account on business FF email
  - create a DO project for production
  - study staging environment, reporduce in production
  - document steps and put them in version control
  - do manual config of production
    - site framework requires website domain name
  - make domain name point to production
  - set up DO alerts and automation
- 2 if not already, finish FF site content for publication (time estimate: 2 days)
  - finish homepage
  - finish sign-up flow
  - ToS and PP
- 2 setup donation (time estimate: 1-2 days)
  - create a paypal account on business email
  - put donation button on the footer of the site
  - put in other flows such as sign-up flow
  - NEVER EVER make it intrusive (do the opposite of wikipedia)
  - direct donations into personal checking
  - create a seperate checking account if many donations come in and stays strong without dying out
- 3 finish discord, socials, and beta setup (time estimate: 7 days)
  - configure all socials to have up-to-date info about site
    - reddit
    - twitter
    - discord
  - configure and test discord
    - ensure issue tracking is working on discord
      - Create
        - guidelines, tags
      - Read
        - tags, searching, filtering, easy-to-find
      - Update
        - closure of issue, permissions
      - Delete
        - consider closure instead, permissions
  - define beta roadmap
    - define when beta is done
    - list out features that need to be made to close beta
      - * = must have!
      - *notification system
      - *trouble ticket system
      - transparent commission (self-managed commission that does not affect commission count or limits)
      - client-side file size limit detection (save the client time and fustration)
  - collect feedback
    - how?: survey, discord issues, etc.
    - survey
      - pros: designed to format feedback, declutter discord, private responses
      - cons: potential for fraud, 
    - discord:
      - pros: same platform, easy via discussion system
      - cons: public responses, hard to aggregate data
    - best to go with survey to start
- 4 announce on socials (time estimate: 1 day)
  - twitter
  - reddit
  - discord
  - make time to respond to replys from socials
    - discord will be the heaviest if there are bugs reported
- 5 monitor and rapidly develop (time estimate: continous after previous steps)
  - study and implement tools to monitor service health
  - aspects which are continously acted on:
    - system health
    - bug feedback
    - feature requests
    - monitization studies
      - merch
      - subscription model
      - sponsoring offers
    - community health
      - culture
      - sentiment
      - general feedback
      - active user count
      - user lifetime
    - software health
      - automated tests
      - refactoring
      - effort to business value ratio studies
