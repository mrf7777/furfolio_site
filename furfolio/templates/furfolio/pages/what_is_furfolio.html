<p>
    Furfolio is an online commission management system that helps with the entire commission process.
</p>

<h3>Why Furfolio?</h3>

<p>
    Image an artist wanting to accept commissions for art they create; they may do the following tasks:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Announce they are open for commissions to followers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open a survey page to accept commissions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Manually manage survey results to prevent being overloaded with requests.
        </li>
        <li>
            Track progress of commissions using different software.
        </li>
        <li>
            Manage channels of communication.
        </li>
        <li>
            Organize commissions and offers from the past and present.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Furfolio handles all of these tasks on one platform.
