Offers and Commissions

<p>
    The two main objects in Furfolio are <b>Offers</b> and <b>Commissions</b>.
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Offers...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            are created usually by Creators on the platform.
        </li>
        <li>
            express that a Creator is open to being commissioned as described in the Offer they publish.
        </li>
        <li>
            explain what service is being provided, a price range, and the number of avaliable slots.
        </li>
        <li>
            are time-bound and only allow commissions to be requested before an expiration date.
        </li>
        <li>
            provide functions that regulate the number of commissions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Offers are either <b>open</b> or <b>closed</b>.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Open</b> means that the offer has not expired and the Creator has not forced it closed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Closed</b> means that the offer is not open. Buyers cannot request commissions of closed offers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    An open Offer communicates that it can potentially be commissioned.
    However, even if an Offer is open, you may not be able to commission it; this could be becuase the Creator has configured it to limit incoming commissions using a special rule.
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Commissions...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            are created by a Buyer on an Offer.
        </li>
        <li>
            contain initial requirements from the Buyer about what they want.
        </li>
        <li>
            have their own chat room between the Buyer and the Creator of the offer.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Once a Commission is created, it is put into the <b>Review</b> state.
    The Creator will usually either accept or reject the Commission after looking at the initial requirements and potentially communicating with the buyer.
</p>

<p>
    Here are the different states of a Commission:
    <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">State</th>
                <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="table-group-divider">
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">{% include "furfolio/commissions/state_badge.html" with state="REVIEW" only %}</th>
                <td>The Commission needs to be reviewed by the Creator of the Offer.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">{% include "furfolio/commissions/state_badge.html" with state="ACCEPTED" only %}</th>
                <td>The Creator has decided that they are wanting to work on the Commission.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">{% include "furfolio/commissions/state_badge.html" with state="IN_PROGRESS" only %}</th>
                <td>The Creator is currently working on the commission.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">{% include "furfolio/commissions/state_badge.html" with state="CLOSED" only %}</th>
                <td>The Commission is considered done and no more work is needed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">{% include "furfolio/commissions/state_badge.html" with state="REJECTED" only %}</th>
                <td>The Creator has decided that they are not willing to work on the Commission.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    Every Commission is in one state at a time.
    Between the Buyer and the Creator, only the Creator can change the state of a Commission.
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Self-managed Commissions</h3>

    Self-managed Commissions are a feature that allow Creators to track Commissions that happen outside of Furfolio.
    This means that Furfolio can track Commissions initiated outside of the Furfolio platform.
    When a Creator requests a Commission on their own Offer, that Commission is considered self-managed.
    These types of Commissions are not subject to the Commission limits configured in the Offer.
</p>
<p>
    Self-managed Commissions satisfy cases that Furfolio cannot fully manage:
    <ul>
        <li>
            in-person Commission requests (at convention or elsewhere)
        </li>
        <li>
            to accept special Buyer requests regardless of the Offer limits
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
