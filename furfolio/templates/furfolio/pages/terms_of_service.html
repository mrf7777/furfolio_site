    <li><h2>Changes to Documents</h2></li>
    <ol>
        <li>

            changes, you will be notified through email if you have an account.
            After you have been notified, continuing to use Furfolio implies that
            you agree to the revised documents.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <li><h2>Registration</h2></li>
    <ol>
        <li>

            such an account based on your age. In the United States, you must be 13 years

        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
            You must not create accounts to reserve usernames.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <li><h2>User Created Content</h2></li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Some content on Furfolio may contain adult content. Unless a user is signed in and has
            consented to see adult content, adult content will not be shown.
            If it is determined that you may not be legally allowed to view adult content, we will 
            revoke consent to view adult content on your account until you can provide proof that
            you are 18 years or older.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have the right to publish, display, store, perform, distribute, and change for the
            purpose of allowing Furfolio to provide its services. We do not have exclusive rights to your
            content. We cannot use derivate works of your content for purposes not listed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Content that you create and published must be rated correctly. By default, content that you create
            is considered appropriate for a general audience. If your content contains adult content,
            you must label the content correctly. Failure to do so may result in a warning or suspension.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <li><h2>Content Rating Guidelines</h2></li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                There are two rating categories for content: <b>general</b> and <b>adult</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Content is assumed to be general by default and is considered adult when it satisfies
                <b>any</b> of the criteria in the following table.

                <table class="table table-striped">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="col">Aspect</th>
                            <th scope="col">Criteria</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>

                                Violence that is considered beyond mild.
                                Contains violence or situations that are considered frightening and
                                the probable chance of sever injury or death.
                                Sexual violence is present.

                                Blood is shown in excess and could imply a severe injury such as loss
                                of limbs, or a major cut. Blood that implies a probable near death counts.
                                Disturbing gore is present.
                                Non-sexual depiction of bodily waste is present. Low detail and cartoonistic
                                waste does not count as long as it is not then main focus of the content.

                                Nudity that is cartoonistic and very low detail does not count.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="col">Sexual Context</th>
                            <td>
                                Content has sexual themes or demonstrations. Sexual fetish references,
                                behavior, situations, discussions, and contexts count.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                                Contains liberal use of profanity. Infrequent, non-sexual, and visually small
                                profanity texts do not count. Profanity used to clearly describe sexual situations
                                counts.
                            </td>
